# ForgePulse — Predictive Maintenance & OEE Command Center

**Snowflake CoCo CLI Hackathon 2026 — Predictive Maintenance and OEE Command Center**

A factory's machines stream sensor data into Snowflake. ForgePulse watches
that stream autonomously: it detects developing faults days before failure,
investigates the root cause against the plant's own repair history —
including scanned handwritten reports — creates the work order with parts
and a production-aware schedule, and shows a supervisor everything on a
live deployed console, with the projected OEE impact of acting early.

**Deployed console:** `https://eqln3sb-yrckwdt-cnb10903.snowflakecomputing.app` (Snowflake login required; served by
Snowpark Container Services from inside the submission account)

> The deployed link runs on a 30-day hackathon trial account expiring
> ~17 Oct 2026. The system is fully reproducible from this repo —
> `docs/redeploy.md` plus `sql/08_load.sql` bring an empty account to a
> running console in about an hour. Happy to redeploy on request.

## The doctrine

> **Rules own safety. Retrieval owns grounding. The model owns reasoning.**

Every layer of ForgePulse follows this split:

- **Deterministic rules** decide what is a fault, what severity it carries,
  and what tier of action follows. No model can override the stuck-sensor
  floor or dispatch parts for an instrumentation error.
- **Retrieval** grounds every explanation: the RCA narrative may only cite
  numbers that exist in query results, and fleet history comes from actual
  work orders and actual scanned repair reports found by semantic search.
- **Models reason on top**: a registered XGBoost classifier adds pattern
  probability and explainable factors; Cortex COMPLETE writes the narrative
  from the evidence dossier; a vision model reads the scanned paperwork.

## What happens, end to end

1. **Stream** — a Kafka producer emits 4 sensors × 12 assets every 5
   seconds; a consumer lands batches in `OT.RAW_TELEMETRY`. A Snowflake
   **stream** marks the new rows.
2. **Detect (autonomous)** — a serverless **task** fires every minute, but
   only spends compute when the stream has data. The detection **procedure**
   computes engineered features (z-scores against each asset's own 28-day
   baseline, slopes, variance collapse, vibration→temperature lag
   correlation) and opens an `ANOMALY_EVENTS` row with a fault-pattern ID.
   Idempotency: one open event per asset+mode — an ACTIONED event blocks
   re-alerting (a rule added after the autonomous DAG itself surfaced the
   duplicate-alert bug; see `tests/test_idempotency.py`).
3. **Diagnose (autonomous)** — the next task in the DAG assembles the
   evidence dossier (features that fired, asset context, matching fleet
   work-order history) and writes a finding. `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE`
   turns the dossier into a structured narrative **inside the stored
   procedure**: Observed → Probable cause → Supporting history → Urgency.
   Strict grounding: every number in the text traces to a table row.
4. **Enrich (explainability)** — a worker computes the same features the
   classifier was trained on, runs the **Model Registry** classifier for
   pattern probability, extracts SHAP top factors, embeds the symptoms and
   retrieves the three most similar past repairs from the scanned-report
   corpus by **VECTOR cosine similarity — the search runs inside
   Snowflake**.
5. **Act (autonomous)** — tier rules create the work order: parts checked
   against `SPARE_PARTS_INVENTORY`, the repair scheduled into the lowest-
   load window in `PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE`, notification logged. Sensor
   faults (FP-03) never dispatch parts.
6. **Show** — the deployed console renders it all: live waveforms whose
   display envelope is driven by real values against real baselines, the
   plant floor, the **AI Diagnosis panel** (verdict, confidence,
   top factors, similar past repairs with remedies and downtimes, and
   three evidence-backed questions a supervisor can click), and the
   **OEE bridge**: average unplanned downtime for this failure mode from
   history vs the planned 4-hour stop → hours avoided → availability and
   OEE deltas per line.

## The document layer

Twenty scanned, handwritten repair reports (generated with jitter,
rotation, and scan noise; ground truth in `reports/reports_index.csv`)
are read by a local vision model and validated field-by-field:
**100/100 key fields correct.** The extracted rows live in
`EXTRACTED_REPORTS`; each report is embedded by
`SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EMBED_TEXT_768('snowflake-arctic-embed-m', …)` into a
`VECTOR(FLOAT, 768)` column, searched with `VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY`
in plain SQL (`sql/07_embed_reports.sql`). Fleet learning made visible:
a new fault on one machine cites its siblings' repair paperwork.

## The classifier — an honest MLOps story

The fault classifier (XGBoost, 5 classes, registered in the **Model
Registry** as `FAULT_PATTERN_CLASSIFIER`, version `WITTY_STARFISH_1`)
initially misfired in serving: 99% confident of belt slip on a textbook
bearing fault. Eight documented iterations followed — feature
train/serve skew, RPM regime mixture from production-schedule speed
changes, distribution shift from saturated faults the training sim never
contained, severity miscalibration — each diagnosed with evidence
(per-class feature means vs live values) and fixed at the root. Final
state: serving features computed with the exact training formulas; RPM
features excluded (documented data-regime limitation — FP-04 detection
remains rule-layer); the model now agrees with the rule layer at 98.87%
confidence, served natively via `FAULT_PATTERN_CLASSIFIER!PREDICT_PROBA`
with no Python at inference time, and the rules were the safety floor the
whole time. The full arc is in the session receipts.

## Cortex — gated for a month, native at the end

`SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE`, `EMBED_TEXT_768`, Cortex Search, Document AI
runtime, and `DATA_AGENT_RUN` returned *"not available for trial accounts"*
on every account class this hackathon provided for most of the build —
verified across four accounts including two created through dedicated
hackathon links, with query IDs on the support ticket. The model-role
grant path (`CORTEX-MODEL-ROLE-ALL`) was also tested: the gate sat above
it. ForgePulse was therefore architected as **Cortex-native definitions
with local adapters at runtime**, and shipped that way for six weeks.

The organizers' AI Data Cloud flow lifted the gate in the final week.
The submission account runs **Cortex natively**: RCA narratives are
generated in-procedure by `CORTEX.COMPLETE('llama3.1-70b', …)` against
the evidence dossier, and the twenty-report corpus is embedded by
`CORTEX.EMBED_TEXT_768('snowflake-arctic-embed-m', …)` into
`VECTOR(FLOAT, 768)` and searched with `VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY` —
retrieval end to end inside the account, no local model in the loop.

The adapters remain in the repo as the documented fallback
(`src/llm_worker.py`, `src/embed_reports.py`) for any account where the
gate still applies, and Document AI extraction still runs through local
qwen2.5-vl (validated 100%). Built honest under constraint; swapped to
native the day the door opened.

## CoCo CLI as the deployment agent

The entire system was deployed to this account **by CoCo in agentic
sessions** — schema, 1.24M-row load with verified counts, streams, procs,
task DAG, fault catalog, Cortex-native diagnosis, model registration,
SPCS service. Receipts (prompts, approvals, incidents, self-corrections —
including CoCo detecting its own over-firing delete against a known-good
count and recovering by clean reload) are in `docs/coco-sessions/`.
Three custom **Agent Skills** (`failure-prediction`, `rca-investigation`,
`work-order-dispatch`) let CoCo operate the plant conversationally; both
investigation skills are live-verified in the receipts.

`scripts/deploy.py` where the CoCo CLI is unavailable.
